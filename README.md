# Lightning

Lightning is a very light and shockingly fast feed reader.

## Goal

The goal of Lightning is to create a very light and shockingly fast feed reader.

## Concept

Lightning is a thin client written in JavaScript that runs in the users browser. This client is responsible for loading feeds and displaying them to the user. Feeds are provided by the [Google Feeds API](https://developers.google.com/feed/). Persistence is achieved with (localStorage)(http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html).

## Motivation

I grew really frustrated with Feedly's very long load times (I frequently waited 10 seconds or more to read the news). I tried out a couple of reader for OSX, but I found it very inconvinient jumping back and forth between the reader and the browser (I don't like browsing in my reader).
